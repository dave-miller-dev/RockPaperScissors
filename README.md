# RockPaperScissors
A simple implementation of the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. User's play against the computer, with scores tallied and saved into the accompanying ratings.txt file.

HOW TO RUN:
Run the rockpaperscissors.py file in your terminal.
(The ratings.txt file MUST be in the same directory as the rockpaperscissors.py file, otherwise it will throw an error.)

HOW TO PLAY:
When the program loads the user is asked for their name. (If the user is new, and has not played before, they will be added to the ratings.txt file, and can begin the game. Previous players will be remembered and their score from previous games will remain in tact.)
Simply play your hand, either; Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The computer will then play it's hand in return.
The game is evaluated, and the result is printed to screen. 
If the user WINS, the user will get 100 points per game.
If there is a DRAW, the user will get 50 points per game.
If the user loses the game, you receive no points for that game.

ERROR HANDLING:
Invalid Input: If the user does not input a valid play; Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

COMMANDS:
"!rating": To check your current rating.
"!exit": To close the program. (all ratings will be saved prior to this point)
